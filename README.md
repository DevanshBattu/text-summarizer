## Text Summarization Fine-Tuning using Pegasus Model

This repository contains code and instructions for fine-tuning the Pegasus model for text summarization tasks. Pegasus is a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model developed by Google Research, specifically designed for abstractive text summarization.

Text summarization is the task of generating a concise and coherent summary of a given text document. It plays a crucial role in various natural language processing applications, such as document summarization, news summarization, and more. Pegasus, with its transformer-based architecture, has shown impressive performance on various text summarization benchmarks.
